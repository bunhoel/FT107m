# FT107m# FT107m
This repository contain source code to arduino hardware that control DMS unit from FT-107m to 
set and get frequency as same time read S-meter data like signal, voltage, tx power and so on. 

The code came from ....

The project have three steps, the first are related to basic DMS control up/down frequency set and read frequency dial and read S-Meter signal value. 
The second, evolve replace DMS by a DDS VFO and clone all funcionality of them. Finally, the third will let total control of the rig.
