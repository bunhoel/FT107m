# FT107m# FT107m
This repository contain source code to arduino hardware that control DMS unit from FT-107m to 
set and get frequency as same time read S-meter data like signal, voltage, tx power and so on. 

The code came from ....

The project have three steps, the first are related to basic control of DMS unit to setup frequency , to read frequency from digital display and to present S-Meter signal value. 
The second, is related with the replace DMS by a VFO DDS and clone all functionality of it. Finally, the third will let total control of the radio.
