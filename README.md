This repository contain source code to arduino hardware that control DMS unit from FT-107m to 
set and get frequency as same time read S-meter data like signal, voltage, tx power and so on. 

A brief overview how to control a FT107m through of a computer.

More information can be found at readme2.

The project have three steps, the first are related to basic control of DMS unit to setup frequency , to read frequency from digital display and to present S-Meter signal value. 
The second, is related with the replace DMS by a VFO DDS and clone all functionality of it. Finally, the third will let total control of the radio.
